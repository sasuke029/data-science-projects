The Board has authorized non-employee directors, prior to the beginning of any calendar year, to elect to defer receipt of all or any part of the cash compensation a director might earn during such year under our Outside Directors Deferral Plan (Amended and Restated as of January 1, 2008). Amounts so deferred will be paid to the director upon his or her separation from service, death, or disability, adjusted for any investment gains (or losses) thereon. Alternatively, directors may elect to have deferred compensation credited to a “rabbi trust” established by us with an independent trustee, which administers the investment of amounts so credited for the benefit and at the direction of the trust beneficiaries until their accounts are distributed under the deferred compensation plan. Amounts so credited for the benefit of non-employee directors are invested in investment alternatives selected by the director.

Board and Board Committee Meetings and Attendance at Shareholder Meetings
During fiscal year 2023, the Board of Directors met five times. All members of the Board attended 75% or more of the total number of meetings of the Board and of the committees of the Board on which they served. The Company encourages, but does not require, its directors to attend annual meetings of shareholders. To the best of our knowledge, all directors attended the 2023 Annual Meeting, which was held virtually.

The Board has established an Audit Committee, a Compensation & Long-Term Incentive Committee, and a Corporate Governance Committee, each of which is comprised entirely of directors who meet the applicable independence requirements of the NASDAQ Rules. The committees keep the Board informed of their actions and assist the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility to shareholders. The table below provides membership information as of December 31, 2023, as well as the meeting information for the last fiscal year.
